Centro is a Node.js module for publishing and subscribing to messages over a
network. It includes code for running a server and clients which connect to a
server.

Messages are published to topics which support wildcard matching (single- and
multi-level).

Each message has its own content stream, with full back-pressure support, and
can be delivered to multiple interested clients or exactly one.

All messages are stored in a directory on the server machine's filesystem so no
external services are required. You can run multiple server instances on the
same directory, for example one per CPU core.

Clients can connect to the server using https://github.com/primus/primus[Primus]
(Websockets), TCP, HTTP or in-memory streams.
