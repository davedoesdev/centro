Will use:

  - [mqlobber](https://github.com/davedoesdev/mqlobber)
  - [mqlobber-access-control](https://github.com/davedoesdev/mqlobber-access-control)
  - [qlobber-fsq](https://github.com/davedoesdev/qlobber-fsq)
  - [authorize-jwt](https://github.com/davedoesdev/authorize-jwt)
  - [primus-backpressure](https://github.com/davedoesdev/primus-backpressure)
  - A method for closing streams which drop below a minimum throughput threshold OR set timeout on qlobber-fsq streams (close/destroy after time period)
  - (possibly) [fastest-writable](https://github.com/davedoesdev/fastest-writable)
  - [simple-crypt](https://github.com/davedoesdev/simple-crypt) with stream API addition for optional data encryption
  - [Primus](https://github.com/primus/primus)

This is a work-in-progress!
